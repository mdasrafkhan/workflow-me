# Workflow Management System

A workflow automation platform built with React and NestJS. This system provides visual workflow creation, execution orchestration, and state management for business processes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

A modern workflow automation platform that enables business users to create complex workflows visually while providing developers with a robust, extensible platform.

### What We Built
- **Visual Workflow Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating business processes
- **Automated Execution**: Cron-based processing every 30 seconds
- **State Management**: Complete workflow state tracking and recovery
- **Extensible Actions**: Email, SMS, webhooks, and custom business logic

### Why This Matters
- **Business Process Automation**: Replace manual workflows with automated ones
- **Developer Productivity**: Visual tools reduce custom code for business logic
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of workflows and executions
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and state recovery

## üéØ Key Features

- **Visual Workflow Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface with React Flow
- **Node-Based Architecture**: Extensible node system with custom executors
- **Real-time Execution**: Cron-based workflow processing every 30 seconds
- **State Persistence**: Complete workflow state tracking and recovery
- **JSON Logic Integration**: Decoupled business logic from visual representation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test suite with cleanup management

### Core Components

#### **4 Main Layers:**

- **üé® User Interface Layer**
  - React Frontend with React Flow for visual workflow design
  - Real-time workflow monitoring and management

- **‚öôÔ∏è Backend Services Layer**
  - NestJS API for workflow management
  - Workflow Engine for execution and state management
  - Cron Scheduler for automated processing every 30 seconds

- **üíæ Data Storage Layer**
  - PostgreSQL for workflows and executions
  - Redis for caching and session management

- **üåê External Actions Layer**
  - Email, SMS, and Webhook services for business operations

### Workflow Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant W as Workflow Engine
    participant D as Database
    participant C as Cron Scheduler

    U->>F: Create/Edit Workflow
    F->>A: Save Workflow Definition
    A->>D: Store in PostgreSQL

    C->>W: Process Workflows (Every 30s)
    W->>D: Query New Trigger Events
    W->>D: Create Execution Record

    loop For Each Step
        W->>W: Execute Node
        W->>D: Update State
    end

    W->>D: Mark Execution Complete
```

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React + React Flow + TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS + TypeORM + PostgreSQL
- **Scheduling**: Node-cron + Bull Queue
- **State Management**: XState for complex workflows
- **Business Logic**: JSON Logic JS for rule evaluation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Node Executor System

The system uses a plugin-based architecture with 5 specialized node types:

- **Action Node**: Executes business actions (email, SMS, webhook)
- **Delay Node**: Manages workflow suspension and resumption
- **Condition Node**: Evaluates JSON Logic expressions for branching
- **Shared Flow Node**: Executes reusable workflow components
- **Webhook Node**: Triggers external HTTP calls

### JSON Logic Integration

Business rules are decoupled from code using JSON Logic:

```javascript
// Example: Conditional workflow branching
{
  "if": [
    { ">": [{ "var": "user.subscriptionType" }, "premium"] },
    "send_premium_welcome",
    "send_standard_welcome"
  ]
}
```

### Key Features

- **Cron-Based Processing**: Automated execution every 30 seconds
- **State Management**: XState for complex workflow state machines
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive retry logic and state persistence
- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes new data since last run
